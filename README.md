# Practical MLOps with Vertex AI: Deploying ML Models

This project provides a hands-on introduction to deploying machine learning models using Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform. Participants explore the full MLOps workflow, including data preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment, through a PyTorch-based text classification example.

Using Google Colab, participants prepare and preprocess datasets, train a BERT-based text classifier on the AG News dataset, and evaluate performance with accuracy scores and confusion matrices. The workflow demonstrates how Vertex AI simplifies the operationalization of machine learning pipelines by offering integrated tools for model training, scaling, and serving in production environments.
